# AirSwap Widget API {docsify-ignore}
The AirSwap trading widget can be embedded in any webpage with just a few lines of code. See live examples on [Bounty0x](https://alpha.bounty0x.io/bounties) and [AdChain](https://publisher.adchain.com/domains). To add token trading to your web app, simply drop in the `JavaScript` library into your webpage and try out the examples found in the [widget](widget/introduction.md) folder.

# AirSwap API Server {docsify-ignore}
AirSwap provides an API server that you can run locally to interact with all of the API methods. Developers can interact with the API over HTTP using any programming language. Prospective order makers will need to implement an Order Server in order to receive `getOrder` requests that are forwarded from the API Server. Further explanation and documentation for each endpoint can be found in the [API Server](serverAPI/introduction.md) section. Order Server reference implementations are also available in [NodeJS](https://github.com/airswap/developers/tree/master/api-server/order-server-examples/nodejs), [Python](https://github.com/airswap/developers/tree/master/api-server/order-server-examples/python), and [Go](https://github.com/airswap/developers/tree/master/api-server/order-server-examples/golang).
