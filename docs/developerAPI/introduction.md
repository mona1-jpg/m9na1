# Introduction

The AirSwap Trading API is an implementation of the [Swap Protocol](https://swap.tech/whitepaper).

The [Swap Protocol](https://swap.tech/whitepaper) outlines peer-to-peer protocols for trading Ethereum-based assets that conform to the [ERC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20) token standard. The protocol whitepaper does not specify the transports or data formats to be used in order to remain flexible. However, our implementation, [AirSwap](https://airswap.io/), does conform to the specifications described below.

**The following is a detailed overview of the API with some low level technical explanations.** If you just want to get started quickly, head over to the [API Server](serverAPI/introduction.md), which provides a user friendly HTTP interface for all of the methods described below.
